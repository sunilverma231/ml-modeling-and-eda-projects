## 1. Insurance Cost Analysis
Analyzed a dataset containing personal and demographic features to predict individual medical insurance charges. Explored relationships between features like age, BMI, smoking status, and region, then built linear regression models to estimate costs.

- Techniques Used: Linear Regression, Data Encoding, Correlation Analysis
- Key Insights: Smoking status and BMI had the highest influence on cost.
